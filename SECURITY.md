## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in TLSleuth, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, contact me **privately** so we can review and patch the vulnerability before disclosure.
You can report vulnerabilities by emailing:  
**range.bay8483@eagereverest.com**  
or via GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce, if applicable.
- Any suggested mitigations or workaround.


Thanks for helping me !
